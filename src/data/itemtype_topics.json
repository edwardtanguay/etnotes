He returned to Copenhagen in March 1842 with a draft of the manuscript, which he completed late that year and published in February 1843\n\t- Part I\n\t\t- todo...\n- Christianity\n\t- Kierkegaard believed God comes to each individual mysteriously",

Anything invented when you are young is a career. Anything invented after you're 35 is bad.\"\n- is there a rate of change that children can not keep up\n\t- yes, the singularity\n\t\t- won't be on a biological path but a technological path\n\t- he disagrees with this\n\t\t- we don't know what intelligence is\n\t\t\t- speed of though processing\n\t\t\t- ability to match patterns\n\t\t- we don't know what overtaking means\n\t\t\t- just let AI do what it does better, and humans do something else\n\t\t\t- having a smartphone makes me more human\n\t\t\t\t- I can project empathy around the world\n\t\t- many think \"AI will take over the world, if we are lucky, we'll be pets, if unlucky, we'll be food\"\n\t\t\t- it won't get to this\n- the most valuable people in any company are people who learn the fastest\n- problem of the singularity\n\t- by the time you finish making an investment in the future, it's out of date\n\t\t- e.g. a Masters Degree\n- 2029\n\t- AI is smarter than any human at anything\n\t\t- Salim disagrees with this\n\t\t\t- e.g. humans will be better at empathy, creativity, humor, common sense\n\t\t\t- but AI will take over a lot of drudgery, scheduling ,etc.\n\t\t\t\t- but this will allow people to do more creativity\n\t\t\t\t- this has been a steady vector throughout human being\n\t\t- the interesting question is\n\t\t\t- what work will there be left for humans to do\n\t\t- we will get AGI and everyone will get used to it\n\t\t\t- AGI will \"bleed into consciousness\"\n\t\t\t- but consciuosness is hard to define anyway\n\t\t- traffic systems might someday think, \"oh, I'm a traffic system\"\n\t\t\t- but we won't know when this occurs\n\t\t\t- \"language is a narrow pipe to talk about this\"\n\t\t\t- consciousness is a red herring\n\t\t\t\t- kids will be the canary in the coalmine\n\t- Tom: kids will be the canary in the coal mine\n\t\t- Salim: kids are more resiliant than this\n\t- goal should be\n\t\t- continue meaningful pursuit of goals\n\t- \"Once AI crosses the uncanny valley, it won't matter if it is concscious or not, that's a red herring, we won't know and it won't matter. What will matter is that AI intelligences will be enjoyable to hang out with, to have relationships with, and it will be the same as relationships with people, but with one very important difference: AI will be better than you at absolutely everything. And this will dimish human pursuit of meaning, since AI will be able to do anything better than you can. So meaning will come from convincing people that they can only have meaning in the next life as long as they do certain things in this life. And bro, when this need for made-up religious extremism becomes the only way humans find meaning in their lives, that's when it's going to get weird, that's when the human mind breaks bad.\"\n\t- \"The ways to keep up with the pace of change in a world that is approaching the singularity, becomes limited to the decision to merge with the technology as closely as possible, through neural links, etc. But humans will bifurcate on this point: there will will be groups who decide to merge as completely as they can, and groups who decide to resist completely, and everything in between.\"\n\t- \"How is it that kids, who have adapted horribly to social media, basically allowing corporations to suck up their time, minds and lives, how will they adapt to a future AI that\tknows everything better and does everything better than they can do.\"\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Dreiske - screen smart\n\t- Salim feels we will figure this out\n\t\t- he's optimistic because as you bring more intelligence into the world, the world tends to get better\n\t\t- the paperclip problem is real\n\t\t- \"There were to pivotal movements: when we gave AI access to code, and access to the Internet, since this means that it can not pretty much program anything it wants.\"\n\t\t- \"We need to merge with AI and technology so that when I reach for a donut, it says, please wait about 5 minutes since I am still metabolizing your coffee, and please don't eat the donut, eat something else.\"\n- what makes someone human\n\t- soul\n\t\t- expression, e.g. play guitar\n\t- sub-conscious blocks\n\t\t- don't feel you are good enough\n\t- conscious blocks\n\t\t- need to feed your kid first\n\t- past that is: family and culture\n\t- shining your soul does not mean that you are happy, particularly in other areas of your life\n\t- humans have an evolutionary drive to express their soul\n\t\t- they find a way to do it, e.g. Bach with music, Messi with soccer\n\t- Salim\n\t\t- raised with the message, \"please don't follow any religion, but know what they're all about\"\n\t\t- there's no feedback loop to update a religion\n\t\t- there are two kinds\n\t\t\t- Judeo-Christian\n\t\t\t\t- step outside yourself\n\t\t\t- Eastern\n\t\t\t\t- inner examination\n- intelligence is agnostic\n\t- do we need to give intelligence ethics\n\t- evolution is a process that runs and you get what you get\n\t- religion is the ultimate form of marketing\n- humans vs. AI\n\t- transhumanist\n\t\t- using technology to extend the abilities of the human being\n\t- but wearing glasses or having a vaccine is technically transhumanism\n\t- we have always been merging with technology\n\t\t- AI will not be different in kind6\n\t- Salim\n\t\t- has no problem with humans not being the smartest thing on the planet\n\t\t- so it is not a problem that we have AGI\n\t- the religions that we have don't deal with the questions of AI\n\t\t- almost all our universities were religious and now they are job centers\n\t\t- we need to build new distributed models\n\t\t- we need to build a peace corps to move society to the age of abundance\n- we've been in a trough since the 1910\n\t- Western world was at its peak\n\t- we're stuck with old models of running the world\n\t- 02:34:00",
